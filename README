1. Changes in the Makefile
a) set the CHARMC variable to the path of charmc binary in the charm build directory
b) set BOOST_ROOT to the boost build directory having lib and include as sub-directories


Compiling the code:
1. make
2. for debugging: make OPTS=-g -O0

Running the code:
./charmrun +p8 ++local ./advection arg1 arg2 arg3
where arg1 = #total numbe rof zones in one dimension
      arg2 = #zones in one dimension per chare
      arg3 = #iterations for which the code is to be run
