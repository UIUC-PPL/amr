1. Changes in the Makefile
a) set the CHARMHOME variable to the path of charm directory


Compiling the code:
1. make
2. for debugging: make OPTS=-g -O0

Running the code:
./charmrun +p8 ++local ./advection arg1 arg2 arg3
where arg1 = max_depth of the mesh (min_depth is fixed to 4 in the code)
      arg2 = #zones in one dimension per chare
      arg3 = #iterations for which the code is to be run

READING ORDER
1. advection.ci - read the entry methods - iterate, remeshing, doComputationStep
2. QuadIndex.h - contains the bit Vector based 2D Quadtree implementaion
                provides interface to get neighbor indices, child indices, etc.
3. Advection.C - contains implementation of boundary exchange functions, iterpolation, 
                finite state machine for granularity decision consensus, refinement and
                coarsening functions, etc.
